The Difference God Makes. 
A Reflection on a talk by Cardinal George.

Live life so that it would not make sense if God did not exist. Would you perform your job any differently if God didn't exist? Catholocism must invade your life, must publically show within your decisions, behaviours, how you live your life. The faith is PUBLIC. Vatican II as a missionary council- make the church more effective in evangelizing the world. "Christ is the Light of the Nations" = "Lumen Gentium". 'Modernity' characterized by freedom of autonomous will to determine. The catholic view: Our real freedom is situated in the wider context of the objective truth. definied by objective truth: put in relation to revelation, not defined by my will: juxtaposition of relation & truth. Doctrine of creation: Prior to any choice of ours we are connected to God, and through God we are connected to everybody and everything. Communion is already given to us. God is love, the Trinity. Love is the deepest structuring truth. Man is already coming from love, from God. Authentic freedom is found by confirming to follow & be a person of love. Freedom & truth in harmony.
