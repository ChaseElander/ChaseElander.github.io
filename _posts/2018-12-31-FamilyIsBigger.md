Family is Bigger- A Prayer

I am a beloved child of the Father. Lord, help me stay humble this year. Break down my pride and bring me to your embrace. Put me on my knees, begging to see you Lord. Set my heart aflame in your presence. I love you God.Thank you for my life. Thank your for every life I come into contact with each and every day, and all the lives ever created. You are my Father, my God and Lord I need to find your will again. Let me see your desires for me. Give me strength only when I will not abuse it. Let me use everything I am to be yours. I am loved by the creator of the universe. Let me live my life showing I love you too Lord. Let my deeds point to only your love and the glory of your name. I desire to pray to you always. I desire to be the man you made me. Help me to stop acting like a child. My peace is in our time together. Prayer and being present to you, I am fulfilled. For me to lead your children to you, let me show and speak and do your will for others for your love. Take my lonliness and stay with me Father. I miss you. I miss my worldly family God. I pray to meet the family and community you have planned for me this year. I love you ABBA.
