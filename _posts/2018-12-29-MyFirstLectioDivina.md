Luke 3:21-22
	21 After all the people had been baptized and Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, heaven was opened 22 and the holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”
	
R:Jesus and others welcomed formally into the church, heaven's opening is literal, but also speaks of each of our hearts. It's easy to be lost without and even with God. Beloved son; With you I am well pleased. Mistakes, it is all wiped away since God is present and as soon as you choose to be truely present to him everywhere in your life.
