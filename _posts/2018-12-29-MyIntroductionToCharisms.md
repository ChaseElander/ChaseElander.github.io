1 Corinthians 12:7-10, 12

	7 To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit. 8 To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom; to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit; 9 to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit; 10 to another mighty deeds; to another prophecy; to another discernment of spirits; to another varieties of tongues; to another interpretation of tongues.

	12 As a body is one though it has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, are one body, so also Christ.

The holy spirit can not be removed entirely until failing to enter heaven & or purgatory. Jesus personally instilled your charisms at baptism. We must practice and give our charisms to the world.Five Thresholds of Conversion: Initial Trust, Spiritual Curiosity, Spiritual Openess, Spiritual Seeking, Intentional Disciples. 73% of confirmed high schoolers will not be active practicers of the Catholic faith 6 years later.
