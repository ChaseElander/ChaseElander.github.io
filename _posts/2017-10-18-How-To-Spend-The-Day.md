## Daybreak
My day began with my alarm going off. 
As I turned over on my side to grab my phone, I underwent the battle that i'm sure everyone faces in that moment. 
-Do I press snooze? Or do I get up and have a comfotable pace in my morning routine? 
Today I elected to wake up on my first alarm, get ready, cook & eat breakfast, and make myself some tea to take to go.
I had the opening shift for St.Mary's Catholic Center at a crisp 45 degrees at 6:30 am. 
It's quiet and serene in the morning there, unlocking the doors to the student and activity centers, the church and the chapel.
Saying good morning to Jesus is particularly nice, and I pause for a moment to pray before continuing.
Pick up around the grounds, change some trash bags, and then I'm off back to the house for a shower and study session before my adoration hour at 9 am. 

## Class
Programming Lab starts off my classes today, as I code in my designated basement computer lab with no windows. It's not as bad as it seems, the cave atmosphere actually makes me more productive.
After class I head bak to "home base" of St. Mary's student center to do somemore studying and to see my friends. 
Eventually I go grab a sandwhich from The Chicken and head off to my second class and from there to my last, which I had an exam in today. 

## The Day
Finally I've completed my work for the day, both literal and in my studies. And the question perks up. How to spend today?
I contact a few friends about eisting plans, seeing who needs to reschedule, who wants to study, hang out, or grab a beer together.
Heading to the Rockyard I change into shorts. (It's now 85 degrees outside and my pants and long sleeves are making me sweat).

Drinking a Gatorade I decide to work ahead on a few essays and prepare the fire pit out back for a bonfire in the near future. 
I make a grocery list, and check my workload for the rest of the week before allowing myself to relax, write, mess around with programming and learn about something that interests me.
Often this ends up being Space or Video Games. I should give up vieo games. I enjoy them, but there are more satisfying/productive manners of liesure.

### How To Spend The Day
And yet, after my morning and afternoon are over, even as the sun sets and night begins, I ask myself one more time; "How should i spend today?"
